Steps to install

1/ Install Ubuntu as per normal

Just follow a standard Ubuntu installation with the variant of your choice. Recommendations are:

* Lubuntu (i386/i686/"32-bit" variant) - very lightweight Linux operating system for reviving old machines
* Ubuntu MATE - another lightweight Ubuntu variant, for a classic desktop experience that's easy to use
* Ubuntu - the standard distribution with the Unity interface

2/ Install Our-PXE and its tools

You need to be connected to the Internet for the next steps.

Once booted into the freshly installed system, open a terminal by using the keyboard shrotcut [Ctrl + Alt + T] and then:

* type "sudo su" and then Enter; then type your password.
* type "cd" and Enter
* type "apt-get update" - you will see a lot of text flowing down the screen; if you se a lot of scary error messages, you are probably not connected to the Internet - fix this, and then type "apt-get update" again.
* type "apt-get install git" and Enter
* type "git clone https://github.com/taikedz/our-pxe"
* type "our-pxe/bin/setup.sh"

At this point you can close the terminal.

You can now customize the desktop look and feel.

Note: if you want to create a desktop background that every user in the new system will have when they first are created, download the wallpaper picture you want; save the picture to Computer:/partimus ; then customize your desktop background to use that same file.

3/ Create the custom installation CD

On your desktop there is a file called "SpinMe" - open it to launch the creation process. When the CD is ready, you will see a window open where the CD's .ISO file has been created.

You will also see the respin.log report on your desktop.:w

You can now burn this ISO file to a writable DVD using the Brasero application.
